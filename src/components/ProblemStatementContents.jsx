                    In Nigeria, the current pharmaceutical distribution model is
                    two-fold: traditional open drug market system, and the
                    modern wholesale system. The open drug market system has
                    been in existence for decades, and consists of real
                    traditional markets where medicines are sold as commodities,
                    just like normal goods. Successive NAFDAC administrations
                    have tried to shut down this model and close such markets
                    since the days of Prof Dora Akinyuli through the use of
                    legislation and enforcement, but has been unsuccessful till
                    date. Examples of such markets are Idumota drug market in
                    Lagos, Headbridge market in Onitsha, Sabongari market in
                    Kano, Ariaria market in Aba etc. They are easier for
                    customers to access, and their complex operations span the
                    entire country, eve extending to our West African neighbors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But quality control is lax, and several unethical practices
                    are conducted everyday across these markets, including drug
                    counterfeiting, improper storage practices, drug peddling
                    etc, making this model and archaic and dangerous model for a
                    sensitive products such as pharmaceuticals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The modern wholesale model is what NAFDAC & PCN recommends,
                    which entails pharmacies registered as wholesalers only,
                    arranging their products on shelves for registered customers
                    (retail pharmacies and hospitals) to come and buy. These
                    outlets are more compliant to NAFDAC regulations, are
                    ethical and possess proper storage & temperature control
                    systems in place. Examples of such outlets include Hmedix
                    pharmacy in Abuja, Alpha Pharmacy in Lagos, Kuka medicals in
                    Kano, New Height Pharmacy Lagos etc. Their customers
                    oftentimes walk-in with the list of medications to purchase,
                    and walk round the store to pick them, often with the help
                    of shelf owners. Currently, most customers prefer to buy
                    through modern wholesalers due to the fact they are well
                    regulated, hence most products in their inventory are of
                    good quality, and NAFDAC conducts regular spot checks on
                    them to ensure they stick to the rules of engagement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, a lot of inefficiencies happen during this process,
                    with customers wasting precious time inside the outlets
                    selecting their items on the shelves, proceeding to
                    invoicing, then payments, and finally cross-checking. An
                    average customer spends a minimum of 3 hours in one of these
                    outlets to purchase the medications on their list, and
                    oftentimes they have to visit two or three of these outlets
                    in a day in order to get all the items they need because one
                    single wholesale outlet will most likely not have everything
                    they need. Recognizing this inefficiency, some outlets now
                    have whatsapp channels where customers can send their orders
                    in a list, and they package it for them to come and pick up.
                    Thus, most customers are craving for an improved process in
                    this pharmaceutical supply and delivery business.
